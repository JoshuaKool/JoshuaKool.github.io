I am doing the software developer level 4 course this is given by the bit academy. The languages ​​I have worked with are html/css, php, sql, lua and C#. The languages ​​I find interesting are php, C# and lua. Php because of what you can do with it and how you have to give things to make it work. C# and lua mainly because of how that language is and how you give things, for example: if your character is touched by an enemy, your character is reset or that you make things work together. The best thing about programming is the challenge that comes with it and the satisfaction when something works completely.
